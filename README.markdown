An HTTP client, by Shrikant.

This is a *simple*, *light*, *in-browser*, HTTP client app that I wanted for myself and wished someone would build it
one day. Well, had to do it myself in the end.

## Inspirations

- HTTP Client for Sublime Text: <https://requester.org/>.
- HTTP Client for VS Code: <https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient>.
- REST Client for IntelliJ based IDEs: <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html>.
