# About

Prestige is an HTTP client, a developer tool for people working with APIs and other HTTP endpoints.

I've had the idea for a text-based HTTP client like Prestige for several years now, but I've been working on this latest
incarnation of the idea since late 2019. One of the more well-received previous implementations is the
[roast.vim](https://github.com/sharat87/roast.vim) plugin that does a version of this idea as a Vim plugin.
